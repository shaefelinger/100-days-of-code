writing myCodepedia takes a lot of time but it is totally worth it. it covers a lot of principles from the learning to learn-course:

- repetition

- it also applies the feynman principle ("if you want to undestand something really well, you need to be able to teach it"):  my goal is to structure the information as if i would have to teach it
